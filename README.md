## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandunMadhushan/EduConnect-LMS.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd EduConnect-LMS
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
**For Windows:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv virt
# Activate virtual environment
source virt/Scripts/activate
```

**For macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv virt
# Activate virtual environment
source virt/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env
```

Add the following required environment variables to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_USER=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_HOST=your_database_host

# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Application Configuration
UPLOAD_FOLDER=path_to_upload_folder
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

# Microsoft Azure Communication Services Configuration
CONNECTION_STRING=your_azure_communication_services_connection_string
SENDER_ADDRESS=your_sender_email_address
```

Environment Variables Description:
- `DB_USER`: Database username for authentication
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password for authentication
- `DB_NAME`: Name of the database to be used
- `DB_HOST`: Database host address
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI services
- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: Path where uploaded files will be stored
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for Flask application security
- `CONNECTION_STRING`: Connection string for Azure Communication Services
- `SENDER_ADDRESS`: Sender email address for Azure Communication Services

6. Run the application:
```bash
flask run
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`

### Email Sending on Registration

To enable email sending when a user registers, ensure you have the Azure Communication Services set up. The application will use the connection string and sender email specified in the .env file to send registration confirmation emails.

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment
When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation:

1. Make sure you have the correct Python version installed
2. Ensure all prerequisites are met
3. Check if the virtual environment is activated (you should see `(virt)` in your terminal)
4. Try removing the virtual environment and starting fresh:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   rmdir /s /q virt
   
   # macOS/Linux
   rm -rf virt
   ```
