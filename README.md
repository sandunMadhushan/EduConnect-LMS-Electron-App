- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

#### Step-by-Step Installation for Development

1. Clone the Electron app repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandunMadhushan/EduConnect-LMS-Electron-App.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd EduConnect-LMS-Electron-App
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
touch .env
```

Add the following required environment variables to your `.env` file:
```bash
# API Configuration
API_URL=your_api_url
```

5. Run the application in development mode:
```bash
# Using npm
npm run start

# Using yarn
yarn start
```

#### Building the Desktop Application

To build the application for distribution:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build

# Using yarn
yarn build
```

This will create distributable packages in the `dist` directory.

#### Configuration Files

The Electron application uses several important configuration files:

1. **package.json**: Contains dependencies, scripts, and Electron Builder configuration:
```json
{
  "name": "educonnect-lms",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Collaborative Learning Management System",
  "main": "main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron .",
    "build": "electron-builder",
    "release": "electron-builder --publish always"
  },
  "build": {
    "appId": "com.educonnect.lms",
    "productName": "EduConnect LMS",
    "mac": {
      "category": "public.app-category.education"
    },
    "win": {
      "target": [
        "nsis"
      ]
    },
    "linux": {
      "target": [
        "AppImage",
        "deb"
      ],
      "category": "Education"
    },
    "publish": {
      "provider": "github",
      "owner": "sandunMadhushan",
      "repo": "EduConnect-LMS-Electron-App"
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "electron-updater": "^5.0.1",
    "electron-log": "^4.4.8"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "electron": "^22.0.0",
    "electron-builder": "^23.6.0"
  }
}
```

2. **main.js**: The main Electron process file that handles window creation, app lifecycle, and updates:
```javascript
// Example structure (key parts)
const { app, BrowserWindow, ipcMain } = require('electron');
const { autoUpdater } = require('electron-updater');
const log = require('electron-log');

// Configure logging
log.transports.file.level = 'info';
autoUpdater.logger = log;

// Create main window function
function createWindow() {
  const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 1200,
    height: 800,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true,
      contextIsolation: false
    }
  });

  mainWindow.loadURL('https://educonnect-lms.onrender.com/');
  // Or for local development:
  // mainWindow.loadFile('index.html');
}

// App ready event
app.whenReady().then(() => {
  createWindow();
  autoUpdater.checkForUpdatesAndNotify();
});

// App lifecycle events
app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') app.quit();
});

app.on('activate', () => {
  if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) createWindow();
});

// Auto-updater events
autoUpdater.on('update-available', () => {
  log.info('Update available');
});

autoUpdater.on('update-downloaded', () => {
  log.info('Update downloaded');
});
```

### Email Sending on Registration

To enable email sending when a user registers, ensure you have the Azure Communication Services set up. The application will use the connection string and sender email specified in the .env file to send registration confirmation emails.

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment
When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation:

#### Web Application
1. Make sure you have the correct Python version installed
2. Ensure all prerequisites are met
3. Check if the virtual environment is activated (you should see `(virt)` in your terminal)
4. Try removing the virtual environment and starting fresh:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   rmdir /s /q virt
   
   # macOS/Linux
   rm -rf virt
   ```

#### Desktop Application
1. Make sure you have the correct Node.js version installed
2. Try clearing npm/yarn cache:
   ```bash
   # npm
   npm cache clean --force
   
   # yarn
   yarn cache clean
   ```
3. For build issues, check if all required dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   npm install --global windows-build-tools
   
   # macOS
   xcode-select --install
   
   # Linux
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```
